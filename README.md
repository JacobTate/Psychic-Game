To play you press a letter.
the computer randomly picks a letter you must guess the letter.
you can press non letter keys. but the computer will not pick a non letter.
im working on making it so you cannot press other keys.
also another bug when you run out of guesses the guessed letter display will not fully reset until you use another guess.
The colsole logs an error when you win the game with the hint closed.
