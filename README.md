To play you press a letter.<br>
The computer randomly picks a letter You must guess the letter.<br>
You can press non letter keys. but the computer will not pick a non letter.<br>
I am working on making it so You cannot press other keys.<br>
UPDATED: FIXED`Also another bug when you run out of guesses the guessed letter display will not fully reset until you use another guess`<br>
The colsole logs an error when you win the game with the hint closed.
